### This is a configuration file required by the ViVan completeAnalysis.py script
### it should contain all the information for the analysis to run
### please update the different sections according to your analysis

### This is the samples section
### format : sampleName <tab> groupName <tab> fastq file1 [<tab> fastq file2 if paired-end] 
### sample name should not start with a digit and should be unique for each sample. different samples can belong to the same group.

#samples_start
sample1	mutator	/path/to/fastq/sample1.fq
sample2	mutator	/path/to/fastq/sample2.fq
sample3	antimutator	/path/to/fastq/sample3.fq
#samples_end

### This is the reference and features section. 
### format : groupName <tab> reference file <tab> features file
### each group requires a reference sequence file and a features file (describing the different genes in the viral genome)
### please see the example features file before creating one

#referencesNfeatures_start
mutator	/path/to/reference/mutator.fasta	/path/to/features/mutator-features
antimutator	/path/to/reference/antimutator.fasta	/path/to/features/antimutator-features
#referencesNfeatures_end

### This is the filters section where coverage and P-Value thresholds can be set
### format : filterName (coverage/pval) <tab> value

#filters_start
coverage	10
pval	0.05
#filters_end
